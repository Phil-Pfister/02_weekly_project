# Portfolio for Phillip Pfister

This web document is a responsive website with links to various projects that I have created during my enrollment in Rice University's Coding Bootcamp.  This repo is designed to be viewed by potential employers who would like to see examples of my abilities.

## Installation

Navigate to the website: [https://phil-pfister.github.io/Phillip_Pfister_Portfoilo/](https://phil-pfister.github.io/Phillip_Pfister_Portfoilo/#contactMe) to view this portfolio

The page looks like this:

## Usage

There are links in the navigation bar that will take you to specific parts of the document and links to other websites that were created by me or with me as part of a group. There are also links at the bottom of the page with various ways to contact me or view my resume and social media presence. I created and deployed a "under contruction" page for items that haven't been created yet to use as a placeholder. The link to that repository is here: [Under Construction Repo](https://github.com/Phil-Pfister/under_construction)
